1. INTRODUCTION



It’s 2020, our reality has changed. Due to  COVID-19, many of us are working from home, a new way of doing business that requires a dependency on technology like never before. Platforms like Zoom help us to maintain connection and communication with clients, team members, and sometimes family and friends. As a result of social distancing and travel restrictions, advanced technologies such as XR are no longer distant possibilities but instead strong considerations for our new emerging reality. XR has slowly made its way into industries such as education, medicine, entertainment, training, real estate, gaming, and several others. 

The XR technology has seen interesting use cases in business. Almost every industry is using it to meet specific objectives around training, learning, marketing, and customer experience.  With the help of virtual projectors and slides, businesses can target their audience better, thus leading to incredible customer experiences.

The XR is not a device but its a trending technology that we are using today as the combinations of VR,AR,MR. This XR technology allows us to open a way to the emerging future technologies. It can easily develop a virtual-real environment where we can touch, sense and smell the real world entities with the help of newest technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, computing devices and  virtual reality continnum.

The recently happened mars exploration of perseverance rover is tested in NASA before its creation with the help of XR technology whereas, its prototype designed model were created in a virtual environment using computing devices, applies statistical studies of mars surface with machine learning, working of rover in such a surface is created using artificial intelligence.


2. XR - Extended Reality
A new term has lately been widespread in the immersive technology world.
This is XR [Extended Reality]. The concept is a fusion of AR [Augmented 
Reality], MR [Mixed Reality] and VR [Virtual reality]. Thus, with these full-scale 
mature technologies, the user generates new forms of reality by bringing physical 
objects into the digital world and vice versa.
In a typical scenario, the process involves creating holographic images and 
letting humans interact with them. XR, is thus an awesome combination of the 
Completely Real World and the Completely Virtual World without any borders 
differentiating the two. The meaning of XR has been currently broadened to 
include technologies of extended Intelligence.
Those developing XR technologies are battling with some of the challenges to 
mainstream adoption. First, XR technologies collect and process huge amounts of 
very detailed and personal data about what you do, what you look at, and even 
your emotions at any given time, which has to be protected.
In addition, the cost of implementing the technology needs to come down; 
otherwise, many companies will be unable to invest in it. It is essential that the 
wearable devices that allow a full XR experience are fashionable and comfortable 
as well as always connected, intelligent, and immersive. There are significant 
technical and hardware issues to solve that include but are not limited to the 
display, power and thermal, motion tracking, connectivity and common 
illumination—where virtual objects in a real world are indistinguishable from real 
objects especially as lighting shifts.
