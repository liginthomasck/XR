1. INTRODUCTION



It’s 2020, our reality has changed. Due to  COVID-19, many of us are working from home, a new way of doing business that requires a dependency on technology like never before. Platforms like Zoom help us to maintain connection and communication with clients, team members, and sometimes family and friends. As a result of social distancing and travel restrictions, advanced technologies such as XR are no longer distant possibilities but instead strong considerations for our new emerging reality. XR has slowly made its way into industries such as education, medicine, entertainment, training, real estate, gaming, and several others. 

The XR technology has seen interesting use cases in business. Almost every industry is using it to meet specific objectives around training, learning, marketing, and customer experience.  With the help of virtual projectors and slides, businesses can target their audience better, thus leading to incredible customer experiences.

The XR is not a device but its a trending technology that we are using today as the combinations of VR,AR,MR. This XR technology allows us to open a way to the emerging future technologies. It can easily develop a virtual-real environment where we can touch, sense and smell the real world entities with the help of newest technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, computing devices and  virtual reality continnum.

The recently happened mars exploration of perseverance rover is tested in NASA before its creation with the help of XR technology whereas, its prototype designed model were created in a virtual environment using computing devices, applies statistical studies of mars surface with machine learning, working of rover in such a surface is created using artificial intelligence.


2. XR - Extended Reality


A new term has lately been widespread in the immersive technology world.
This is XR [Extended Reality]. The concept is a fusion of AR [Augmented 
Reality], MR [Mixed Reality] and VR [Virtual reality]. Thus, with these full-scale 
mature technologies, the user generates new forms of reality by bringing physical 
objects into the digital world and vice versa.
In a typical scenario, the process involves creating holographic images and 
letting humans interact with them. XR, is thus an awesome combination of the 
Completely Real World and the Completely Virtual World without any borders 
differentiating the two. The meaning of XR has been currently broadened to 
include technologies of extended Intelligence.
Those developing XR technologies are battling with some of the challenges to 
mainstream adoption. First, XR technologies collect and process huge amounts of 
very detailed and personal data about what you do, what you look at, and even 
your emotions at any given time, which has to be protected.
In addition, the cost of implementing the technology needs to come down; 
otherwise, many companies will be unable to invest in it. It is essential that the 
wearable devices that allow a full XR experience are fashionable and comfortable 
as well as always connected, intelligent, and immersive. There are significant 
technical and hardware issues to solve that include but are not limited to the 
display, power and thermal, motion tracking, connectivity and common 
illumination—where virtual objects in a real world are indistinguishable from real 
objects especially as lighting shifts.


3. HISTORY


The history goes back a long time, a computer scientist in Sutherland creates a 
VR headset early 90’s. Later the VR technology has arrived and by its 
contradiction the newest technologies like AR & MR has arrived. Afterall XR is 
considered as a new umbrella term used to represent those three technologies. But 
now XR is the emerging technology which combines the those three reality 
technologies. Year 2020 plays major important in the life of XR whereas it 
emerges with combining of artificial intelligence, machine learning computing 
devices with Reality technology.


3.1 AR


Augmented reality (AR) is an enhanced version of the real physical world that 
is achieved through the use of digital visual elements, sound, or other sensory 
stimuli delivered via technology. It is a growing trend among companies involved 
in mobile computing and business applications in particular. AR can be defined as 
a system that fulfills three basic features: a combination of real and virtual worlds, 
real-time interaction, and accurate 3D registration of virtual and real objects.
Augmented reality (AR) adds digital elements to a live view often by using the 
camera on a smartphone. Examples of augmented reality experiences include 
Snapchat lenses and the game Pokemon. 
• Augmented reality (AR) involves overlaying visual, auditory, or other 
sensory information onto the world in order to enhance one's experience.
• Retailers and other companies can use augmented reality to promote 
products or services, launch novel marketing campaigns, and collect 
unique user data.
• Unlike virtual reality, which creates its own cyber environment, 
augmented reality adds to the existing world as it is.


3.2 VR


Virtual reality (VR) refers to a computer-generated simulation in which a 
person can interact within an artificial three-dimensional environment using 
electronic devices, such as special goggles with a screen or gloves fitted with 
sensors. In this simulated artificial environment, the user is able to have a 
realistic-feeling experience. It implies a complete immersion experience that 
shuts out the physical world. Using VR devices such as HTC Vive, Oculus Rift 
or Google Cardboard, users can be transported into a number of real-world and 
imagined environments such as the middle of a squawking penguin colony or 
even the back of a dragon.
• Virtual reality (VR) creates an immersive artificial world that can seem 
quite real, via the use of technology.
• Through a virtual reality viewer, users can look up, down, or any which 
way, as if they were actually there.
• Virtual reality has many use-cases, including entertainment and gaming, 
or acting as a sales, educational, or training tool.


3.3 MR


Mixed reality (MR) is the merging of real and virtual worlds to produce new 
environments and visualizations, where physical and digital objects co-exist and 
interact in real time. Mixed reality does not exclusively take place in either the 
physical or virtual world, but is a hybrid of reality and virtual reality. There are 
many practical applications of mixed reality, including design, entertainment, 
military training, and remote working.
In a Mixed Reality (MR) experience, which combines elements of both AR 
and VR, real-world and digital objects interact. Mixed reality technology is just 
now starting to take off with Microsoft’s HoloLens one of the most notable early 
mixed reality apparatuses.


4. RESEARCH


XR eliminates distance barriers. Extended Reality banishes the 
restrictions due to remoteness and as a result, a number of businesses and 
industrial solutions became prevalent and are being distributed on a larger 
geographical landscape. It also enhances the application of obtaining vital 
insights through better immersion and a 3-dimensional environment.
There are many researches are still ongoing upon the XR technology. 
Few months ahead a Korean scientist who was researching upon the Nikon 
Tesla’s Thought Machine invention that had still not exit where findouts the 
hope of its arrival with the help XR technology and he successfully builded its 
prototype.


4.1 WORKING


XR is not a device and its a emerging technology whereas which combines the 
three realities AR, VR and MR with the artificial intelligence, machine learning 
and computing devices to build a virtual environment in the physical world.
XR is just a technology for the implementation of different platform with the 
help of AI and ML. Whereas it build ups a virtual environment and develops a 
prototype models of real world entities in it. With the help of 3D printers we can 
print out the entities created in the virtual environment to the real world.


4.2 Uses


Numerous companies from the gaming industry, healthcare, 
engineering, entertainment industry, real estate, retail and the military sector 
around the world are already making the most of the technology.
